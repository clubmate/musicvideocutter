# Core dependencies (required)
yt-dlp                # YouTube/Video download
scenedetect          # Video scene detection and splitting  
pyyaml               # Configuration file parsing
opencv-python        # Computer vision and video processing
numpy                # Numerical computing
scikit-learn         # Machine learning utilities (similarity metrics)
tqdm                 # Progress bars

# Optional dependencies for advanced grouping features:
tensorflow>=2.0      # CNN-based similarity (best quality, requires ~2GB disk space)
librosa              # Audio-based similarity analysis
pillow               # Advanced image processing (PIL)
imagehash            # Perceptual image hashing

# Removed packages (no longer used):
# moviepy            # Replaced by direct ffmpeg usage
# matplotlib         # No plotting features used
